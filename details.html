                    <h3>Re-imagining and simplifying the Nav</h3>
                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>The app is designed primarily for users with a paid subscription to the Redbox Instant service.  If you do not have a subscrition you are presented with a series of blank pages. The app knows if you are logged in as well as whether or not you have a current subscription.  With this in mind I propose changing the default home page for users without a subscription or those who are not logged in to the app.  For these users it makes more sense to show them the list of movies available for rent instead of a blank page.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Better Nav</h4>
                    <p>The nav has been improved by better utilizing empty real estate currently occupied by a single drop down and the words "filter off".  I've narrowed the first drop down and removed the filter off text.  I've also added more drop downs for filter options which are currently hidden amd made these drop downs that are easy to identify as clickable options rather than plain text which doesn't relay to a user that it's hiding a drop down menu of options.  Also added are grey text tags identifying the menus.</p>
